<div class = "para"><span id="name">My name is Gloria Nduka.</span> I am from Seattle, WA. I have two parents who are from Nigeria, and I have 3 younger siblings- a brother and 2 sisters. I’ve lived in Seattle all my 18 years of living. I absolutely love everything about my city - especially the rain. I also enjoy the fact that computer science is very prominent there because that is what I am interested in doing in the near future, and the fact that my home is perfect for my passion.

I am very much interested in computer science. I was introduced to computer science my sophomore year of high school. I had no idea that computer science was even such a subject or a profession. As I was a child growing up, I had one profession in mind and that was becoming a doctor before I even knew computer science existed. Thanks to Ms. Martin, I fell in love with coding. Java was the first language I learned. Then coming into the University of Southern California, I was introduced to C++. I am currently learning and working with C++. Alongside learning C++, I was also interested in learning how to make websites, so I am taking a website developing class and learning HTML and CSS. All in all, I have enjoyed all the different languages that I have learned and the art behind them all. I didn’t know and still don’t know all the possibilities here are with coding. I am still trying to understand what I am capable of doing with my talents and my knowledge of the languages. I do know that I want to take my talents and my knowledge outside and make an impact in the world, especially in Nigeria. I enjoy making websites and seeing my creation come into reality in seconds. I also enjoy coding projects that are assigned to me in class. I also enjoy the cooperative and collaborative community that is formed within computer science. I am hopeful that I can do something with computer science in the future.

Aside from coding, I love to sing and play basketball. I sing here and there. I play ball here and there as well. I started playing basketball when I was in 4th grade. I love the art of basketball. I can only workout if my workout is anything basketball related. I have played on school basketball teams and on club teams. I am currently playing on the USC women’s club basketball team. As for singing, I started singing since I was a toddler. I sing mostly pop songs, some country, and a lot of R&B. I enjoy listening to and singing songs written by Adele, Ariana Grande, SZA, HER, Drake, and Demi Lovato. I especially enjoy listening to my Nigerian artists: Yemi Alede, Burna Boy, Kiss Daniel, Davido, Mr.Eazi, WizKid, Mayorkun, Olamide, Maleek Berry,… the list could go on and on and on. I cannot emphasize how much I love my cultural music. However, I can't really sing those songs because I have not yet mastered my native tongue, but I can still dance to them hahahaha. Anyways, I am very into singing – I am taking a performance class at this moment, and I sing with my band, I also took vocal lessons at Stanford University, through Seattle Talent Agency, and at the University of Southern California. I also auditioned for America’s Got Talent and performed at the International Presentation of Performers. I sing at talent shows here and there. I literally cannot emphasize how much I enjoy singing.

Some random information about me: I lowkey model too…like the lowest-of-keys. I enjoy having people take pictures of me while I do my thanggg – posing. My favorite color is blue – any shades of blue. I’m obsessed with boba tea – you’ll see me ordering “original milk tea with no ice and extra tapioca balls.” I also love to drive – the fact that I can’t drive here in LA is a little bit frustrating, but when I get home, I take my baby, Amanda, who is waiting for me in the garage, on drives her whenever the opportunity awaits. I loveeee sushi – especially the kind that has eel in it. Finally, I enjoy trying new things and going to different places. I have always wanted to travel and experience the world outside of Seattle and Los Angeles like some place in Europe, visit Nigeria for the third time, try the South Americas, and elsewhere that is not the west coast of the United States....I hope I didn’t overdo it with my about me page, but um… that’s me.
